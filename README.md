# mkimage

A collection of functions for analysing fluorescence microscopy images of yeast cells. 
Written in Python using `scikit-image`.

## Modules

`site-counter` contains functions I used to count the number of endocytic spots in 3D stacks
as well as cell cross-section area.

`cell_values` was used to mask cells and extract intensity measurements.

`utility` contains helper functions for the two modules above.

def count_patches(im, median_radius=10, erosion_n=3, con=2,

    """
    Count the number of spots and the cross-section area in a 3D image of a single yeast cell.
    
    Input:
    Takes a 3D stack. Performs median filter subtraction, followed by thresholding and 3D erosion.

    Returns:
     - count, int: a number of areas remaining after erosion (number of patches)
     - area, int: the number of nonzero pixels in median-filtered, maximum projected
     and Otsu-thresholded image (cross-section area)
     - images, arr: a hyperstack consisting of three volumes: image after median filter subtraction,
     after thresholding and after erosion. Note: this displays well in pyplot, but axes need to be swapped to save
     as ImageJ compatible .tif

    Parameters:
     - median_radius, int: each slice will be median-filtered with a disk of this radius (default 10)
     - erosion_n, int: a pixel will be eroded unless it has this number of non-zero neighbours in 3D (default 3)
     - con, int: connectivity setting for label function, refer to scikit-image docs (default 2)
     - method, str: method for thresholding; refer to .utility.threshold docstring for a list of allowed methods (default 'yen')
     - mask, bool: if True, spot thresholding ignores background *outside* of the cell (default False)
     - loop, bool: if True, erosion iterates until the image stops changing (default False)
